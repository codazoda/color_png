# color_png

This is a PHP script that returns a PNG image (it does not generate any files) based on an HTML color code you pass on the command line.

To try it out, download the color.php file and run the following PHP command in the directory where you saved it.

  php -S localhost:8888
  
Then open your web browser and point it to the following URL.

  localhost:8888/color.php?c=5BA0D0
  
Change the code at the end to try out other colors.
